# eatHere
A SPA to decide where you should eat when you can't decide yourself

## Stories
As a user, I should be able to...
1. Answer a series of short questions
2. See a recommended place to eat
3. Accept or Reject the recommendation


## Process
* Create some user stories
* Draft some mock-ups to guide the development
* Scaffold the front end quickly using create-react-app
*

## Notes
1. Uses the [Yelp v3 API] (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search)
